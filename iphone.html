                The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. These devices use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. As of 2022, the iPhone accounts for 15.6% of global smartphone market share.

                The iPhone was the first mobile phone with multi-touch technology.[4] Since the iPhone's launch, it gained larger screen sizes, video-recording, waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, iPhones had a single button on the front panel with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with Face ID facial recognition, and app switching activated by gestures. Touch ID is still used for Apple's currently-produced iPhone SE series.

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                For many people, the iPhone has become a storage hub for everything from photo libraries to music collections, books, games and much more. But that also means it can be easy to run out of space. Even though Apple increased the iPhone's default storage from 64GB to 128GB with the iPhone 13, that might not be enough for everyone.  
                The best way to save local storage is to invest in a cloud storage service like Apple's iCloud, Google Drive, Box or Dropbox to offload some of your files. But there are also certain settings you can change to make sure you're using your iPhone's storage capacity to its fullest. When iOS 16 launches, your iPhone will also be able to detect duplicate photos, which should make it easier to keep your image library lean and organized.

        <h3>Ram</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Curious how much RAM Apple has put in its iPhones over the years or how much memory your current iPhone has? While the company doesn’t publicly share the information, memory details surface in teardowns and from other sources like Apple’s supply chain. Read along for a look at the complete iPhone RAM list for how much memory comes with every iPhone model.
                Apple doesn’t publish or put any focus on iPhone RAM for a number of reasons. One of the biggest is iPhone performance outpaces the competition like Android phones with less RAM. Apple is able to do that as it makes both the hardware and software and precisely fine tunes its devices to perform as efficiently and powerfully as possible.
